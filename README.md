        ##### Spring Boot REST API #####
- Overview
This project is a robust implementation of a RESTful API using Spring Boot, a powerful framework for developing Java-based web applications. The API follows REST principles, providing a scalable and maintainable solution for building web services.

- Key Features
  
- CRUD Operations:
    The API supports CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on resources. Each resource is uniquely identified, and standard HTTP methods are used for 
    manipulation.

- Project Structure:

    The project adheres to a well-organized directory structure. It separates concerns such as controllers, services, models, and configurations, promoting code 
    maintainability and readability.

- Spring Data JPA:
  
    Database interactions are handled seamlessly with Spring Data JPA. Entities are represented as Java objects, and CRUD operations are performed without 
    boilerplate code.

- Validation and Exception Handling:
     Request data is validated using annotations, and the API provides meaningful error responses in case of validation failures or unexpected errors. Global 
     exception handling ensures consistent error messages.
